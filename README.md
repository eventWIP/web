This project was set up as part of the GeoHack event and the 2013 FOSS4G Conference.

The project sets out to draw information from public data feeds which allow users to search for outdoor events
and then check to see the impact of the predicted weather on the event. At present the event feeds are from 
external feeds however the project may utilise a database in the future to allow event organisers to view more 
information and therefore to see more detailed interpretation of the weather feeds. This may help the organisers 
to plan ahead and make layout changes in the weeks running up to the event. 

The project consists of an OpenLayers 2 map with JQuery / PHP used to connect to the relevant data feeds. 

In addition, it is the intention that the project is also developed in pararell using HTML5 and OpenLayers 3.
This may be an automatic switch depending on the users browser; lower versions of Internet Explorer do not 
support HTML5.

The project was proposed by the Health and Safety Laboratory and may be further developed as an Open Source 
project; licence type and project future is still to be decided. 

The original demo site was hosted using OpenShift (web-evchallenge.rhcloud.net) however this has changed in 
order to deal with changing project ownerships. For more information on the OpenShift documentation please

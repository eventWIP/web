Location Search
This will return the Songkick Area e.g. Manchester, Liverpool, Stoke on Trent etc. This is known as the metro_area_id and can be used in the other Songkick apis

Skiddle

Shows festivals in UK return XML feed. Unfortunately doesn't return lon lat in the results and is not searchable. However, it does return address of the festival including Town. Therefore Ordnance Survey Open Gazetteer Data could be used to geocode the festivals

Software which could be used with above XML feed.

Known Issues with Data Sources

Difficult to isolate outdoor events from indoor ones. This can sometimes be done by search event type e.g. festival.
Difficult to get numbers of people attending a festival, some apis include information such as venue capacity and popularity. Could also use Facebook likes etc.

Possible Functionality
Pan the map to a location then search for events starting in next 5 days in the area 
Search the Met Office 5 day weather forecast in the same area to find the weather on the day (and time?) of event
Or search the Met Office for bad weather forecast in next 5 days and then look for events near to the bad weather.

Possible Implementations

QGIS Plugin 
Open Layers web page
Mobile Phone application
REST API returning GeoJson
